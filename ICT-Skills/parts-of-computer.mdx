## Parts of a Computer and Peripherals

A computer system is defined as a programmable machine designed to store and retrieve information and perform arithmetic and logical operations to produce meaningful results in the desired format.

The system consists of three main units :

  <Card title="Input Unit">
    Helps the user to enter raw data and instructions into the system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Central Processing Unit (CPU)">
    Performs the required operations based on given instructions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Output Unit">
    Produces meaningful results in the desired format for the user
  </Card>
</Columns>
<Note>In desktop computers, these three units are typically separate devices (e.g., keyboard, CPU box, monitor). In a laptop, all three units are combined into one device. Input and output devices are also referred to as `peripherals`.</Note>

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU is analogous to the human brain, processing information received from input devices and providing output. It is responsible for solving mathematical and logical problems.

The CPU is further divided into three parts :

1. `Control Unit (CU)`: Acts as a receiver and manager, receiving instructions and coordinating between different parts to perform operations.
2. `Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)`: Performs all mathematical and logical calculations. This is also referred to as the Processing Unit.
3. `Memory Unit (MU)`: Functions as a temporary store where small amounts of data are kept while other operations are being performed

## Input Devices
Input devices are used to enter information into the computer. E.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, webcam, etc.

## Output Devices
Output devices retrieve information from the computer and present it to the user. E.g., monitor, printer, speaker, etc.

## Memory Storage Devices
1. `RAM (Random Access Memory)`: Temporarily stores information; information is lost when the computer is switched off; information can be changed easily.
2. `ROM (Read Only Memory)`: Permanently stores information; information is stored even when the computer is off; information cannot be changed easily; mainly used when starting the computer.
3. `Flash Memory`: Used in removable storage devices (like USB); information is not lost when switched off and can be changed easily.

Data storage capacity is measured using the following hierarchy

Bit (Binary Digit, 0 or 1) is the smallest storage unit.
- 8 bits make a byte.
- 1024 bytes make 1 kilobyte (KB).
- 1024 KB make 1 megabyte (MB).
- 1024 MB make 1 gigabyte (GB).
- 1024 GB make 1 terabyte (TB)

## Ports and Connections
Ports are the slots or channels that allow peripheral devices to be connected to the CPU using wires
1. Universal Serial Bus (USB) port: Connects peripheral devices such as a mouse or printer.
2. Display port: Connects the monitor or display unit; includes types like VGA and HDMI.
3. Audio ports: Help connect microphones, speakers, and headphones.
4. Ethernet port: Used for connecting the system to high-speed Internet cable.
5. Power port: Used for connecting the computer system to the power supply
