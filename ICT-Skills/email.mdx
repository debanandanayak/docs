1. Electronic mail (e-mail) is defined as a quick way of sending messages to people using the Internet.
2. It is an electronic message consisting of lines of text and images sent over the Internet from one person to another.
3. The invention of e-mail has made it a popular means of communication because it is fast and easy to use.
4. E-mails can also be sent to multiple people at the same time.

## Components of email

1. **Attachments**: E-mail allows files containing videos, documents, or spreadsheets to be sent along with the message as attachments.
2. **E-mail Address**: The general format is local_part@domain, separated by the @ symbol.
### Advantages

1. E-mails are considered fast (reaching recipients globally immediately).
2. Email is free (as most services do not charge money),
3. Environment friendly because no paper is used.

### Comparison to Postal Mail

Unlike postal mail, which uses a geographical address and is sent via physical transport (bus, air, train) to a letterbox, an e-mail uses a digital address, is written on a computer or mobile device, travels digitally over an Internet connection, and arrives in the receiver’s Inbox.

## Steps to create an email account

To set up an e-mail account, popular service providers include Gmail (run by Google), Outlook mail (run by Microsoft), and Yahoo mail (run by Yahoo). All e-mail hosting sites typically follow similar account creation procedures.

1. Go to www.gmail.com and click “Create an account”.
2. A sign up form will appear, requiring you to fill in details such as your name, username, and password.
3. For security, a password should be at least 8 characters long and must contain letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., $ %#).
4. Other necessary details, like your phone number and country, must also be filled in.
5. You must Review the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, check the box, and then click Next step.

6. The Google welcome page will appear, prompting you to click on ‘Continue to Gmail’ to display your new Gmail account page.

## Writing an email

  3. **Subject:** Write the main **topic of the mail** (e.g., 'Happy Diwali').
  4. **Main Body:** This is where you type the message, including a **salutation** (greeting) at the beginning (e.g., "Hello everyone"), the main message, and a **signature** at the end (e.g., "best wishes" and your name).
  5. **Attaching a File** : You can send a file, such as a photo or document, as an **attachment** along with your e-mail.
