A computer system consists of two primary components:
## Hardware:
These are the physical parts that can be seen and touched, such as the keyboard, monitor, and CPU. Hardware is essentially the machinery of the computer.

## Software:
This is the intangible component that makes the hardware function as desired. Hardware is useless without software.

## Operating System:
This is the software that manages the hardware and provides a user interface. Without an operating system, the hardware would be useless.

<Note>
    The most critical software is the Operating System (OS).
    Examples of operating systems include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## Startup Process of Computer:
1. To begin, press the Power button on the CPU.
2. The computer automatically runs a basic program called BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). The BIOS performs a self-test (POST).
3. If the system is fine, the BIOS loads the Operating System.
4. The welcome screen and then the login screen appears.
5. The desktop is displayed after successful login.

## Login and Logout:
Login-IDs and passwords ensure that only authorized people access individual files and applications. Once work is finished, one must log out or sign out to prevent unauthorized access.
## Shutting Down:
In Ubuntu, you click "Systems" (at the top right) and then select "Shut Down". The Operating System handles the closing of applications before powering off the computer

## Using the Keyboard
The keyboard is an input device used to enter text, numbers, and commands. Key groups include:

- Function Keys: Keys labelled F1 to F12, performing specific, program-dependent actions (e.g., F1 typically provides help).
- Control Keys: Include CTRL, SHIFT, ALT, CAPS LOCK, SPACEBAR, and TAB, which perform specialized functions based on context.
- Enter Key: Moves the cursor to the beginning of a new line, or confirms a task/sends commands in specific programs.
- Navigation Keys: Such as arrow keys, HOME, END, PAGE UP, and PAGE DOWN, used for moving around a document.
- Command Keys: Include INSERT (INS), DELETE (DEL), and BACKSPACE, used for removing or overwriting typed text.
- Windows Key: Pressing this key opens the Start menu.

## Using a Mouse
The mouse is a small device used to move, select, and open items on the screen. Key mouse functions include:

- Roll over/Hover: Bringing the mouse pointer over an item without clicking (e.g., showing file details).
- Point and Click: Moving the pointer to select an item.
- Double-click: Quickly clicking the left button twice, often used to open a file.
- Drag and Drop: Clicking an item, holding the button down, moving the item to a new location, and then releasing the button.
