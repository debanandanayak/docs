## File

All information stored in a computer is kept in files. Each file is given a file name and a file name extension that identifies the file type. The name and extension are separated by a period or 'dot'. Examples of file extensions include .txt (for a simple text file, such as one created by Notepad), .doc, .xls, .jpg (for an image file), and .mp3 (for a sound file).

## Folder

A folder is a location used to store a group of files.

## Creating and Saving a File

1. In Ubuntu, type ‘editor’ in the search dialog box and double-click the text editor option to open a blank document. In Windows, you can open Notepad by typing it in the Windows Search bar.
2. You can then add text to the document.
   3.To save the file, click Save. In the Save As dialog box, you must browse to the desired folder (e.g., Desktop), type the file name, and click Save.
